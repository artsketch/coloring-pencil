<h3 id="the-modern-biro-was-invented-by-mr-bíró-from-hungary-1938">The modern biro was invented by Mr Bíró from Hungary 1938.</h3><p>We take pride in handcrafting quality pencils and artist materials using traditional methods passed down for six generations. As long ago as 4000BC people started using crude pens made from straws or feathers dipped in liquid and were in use in some shape or form right up until the 1800s when the first steel tipped pens and fountain pens were invented. Shortly thereafter a superior technique was discovered. Even though technology was changing a classic pencil still had a place in the world. The first rubber eraser was developed in the year 1770 by an English engineer Edward Nairne.</p>
