<p>Given the importance of the human brain eye and hand there may be nothing as fundamental for the production. This is always done with a sharp pencil to avoid fraud. For preliminary sketches that will be used as a guide for a painting or illustration the lighter 2H4H pencils are ideal. The HB is equivalent to the American Number 2 pencil youve used for years. It is lighter in shade. If you are going to work with charcoal pencils I suggest that you buy an HB 2B 4B and a 6B by a brand called Generals. By Artist For Artist Home Facebook.</p>
