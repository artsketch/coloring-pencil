<p>Hii guys i am found a method to draw x in square without lifting your pen. Draw the house outline and then turn over the corner of the paper to transfer the pen without ever removing it from the paper. You start out at the bottom left corner then draw a line diagonally up to the upper right corner. Your drawing is one continuous line but with shape and detail. The existence of an Eulerian trail in a connected graph is directly linked to the number of vertices which have an odd degree the degree of a vertex is the number of. Go up then partway down then up.

First draw a house the quickest way and ask your friend to try drawing it in one go without crossing lines or taking the pen off the paper. Draw it with two pens at once. Tell them it IS possible. The degree of a vertex of the shape is the number of lines leading out from it.
