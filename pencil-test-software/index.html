<p>Pencil is a cross-platform open-source 2D animation software. The animators on every major 2D animation film since 2002 used FlipBook to do their pencil tests. A new Animation Pencil Test capture station. THANKS FOR TRYING PENCIL TEST PLUS. If you have enjoyed using Pencil Test Plus please spread the word and share it. This is an idea I had kicking around in the back of my head and I finally had time to get it started. Pin On Film Is Fabulous.</p>
