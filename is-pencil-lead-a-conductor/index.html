Pencil lead these days is a mixture of graphite and clay. Pencil lead is largely made of graphite a form of carbon hence pencil lead will conduct electricity. The pencils are made of wood glue metal rubber and pure graphite. What we call pencil lead is actually a substance called graphite which consists of many stacked sheets of carbon atoms.</p>

<p>Graphite is a moderately good conductor for a non-metal. That being said unless the voltage exceeds the BIL basic insulation level of the wood encasing the graphite or the wood is cracked or wet chances are you will not be aware of the current in the pencil. Clay unlike graphite is an insulator as it does not conduct electricity well due to the covalent bonds holding valence electrons tightly in place. The lead in pencil is made up of a combination of graphite and clay with wax and other additives in small quantities. Its a bit better of a conductor than tap water and much better than wood rubber or glass which are insulators. But its not up there with copper and silver. Pin On Useful Objects.</p>
