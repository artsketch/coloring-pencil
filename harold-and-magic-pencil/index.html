Harold wants to go for a walk in the moonlight but theres no moon so he draws one. It was around this time that brothers Merril and Harold Hassenfeld Providence natives whose family owned a little toy maker by the name of Hasbro Hassenfeld brothers acquired Empire. DoodleBob or DoodleBoy as called by SpongeBob at certain times is a crudely-drawn self-portrait of SpongeBob SquarePants that is the main antagonist of the SpongeBob SquarePants episode called Frankendoodle Because he was created using a magic pencil which belonged to a human artist at sea who accidentally threw it into Bikini Bottom which SpongeBob and Patrick found. In Harold and the Purple Crayon Harold draws a world line by line from beginning to end.</p>
