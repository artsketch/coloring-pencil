<p>Using the numeric scale the 2 pencil is exactly as described. The reason is simple. Today most pencils using a HB system and lead grades will be designated a number and letter combination. Generally speaking a 1 pencil is the equivalent of a 2B a 2 pencil the equivalent of an HB and a 3 pencil is the equivalent of a 2H. If youre looking for really dark shading go for 4B pencils or 6B pencils. It means that the pencil is hard and black and also depicts the hardness and nature of the lead used in a pencil.
